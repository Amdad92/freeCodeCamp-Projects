# freeCodeCamp-Projects
This repository contains all my practice projects from the freeCodeCamp curriculum, organized into separate folders for better clarity and management. Each folder represents a unique project that demonstrates my progress and understanding of web development concepts, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design.
